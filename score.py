#Score Management:
# Implement a scoring system for the game. Fewer guesses should yield to a higher score.
# When the game is won:
# check if the current number of guesses is lower than the player's stored best score in highscores.txt.
# Update the file only if the score is better.


# Leaderboard:
# The leaderboard should display the top 5 players (username and best score), sorted by score (ascending).
