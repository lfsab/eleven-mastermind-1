# Encryption: Implement a simple substitution 
# or Caesar cipher for the password (no external libraries allowed).

# New User Registration
# 1. Ask for a username and password for new players.
# 2. Check if the username already exists (case-insensitive) in players.txt. 
# If it exists, deny registration and prompt again.
# 3. Encrypt the password and store the pair in players.txt.


#Suggestion:
# QoL: If players exists from database [players.txt], prompt user and proceed to login
